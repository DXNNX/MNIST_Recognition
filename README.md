# MNIST_Recognition

OOP implementation of a MLP. Uses elu activation functions, cross entropy with softmax (softmax taken out for debugging purposes at the moment). Processes each batch as a matrix. Truncated initialization of weights. 

Doesn't quite work yet. Cost function is steadily decreasing, but much too slowly for things to be working as intended (hundreds of epochs not enough to fit 10 samples).
